 <h1>Kharma-Nailah Johnson</h1>
 <p>I am a final year Computer Science student with an interest in education and language.
     I intend all the objectives I have laid out for myself. 
     I find this aspect of computing very enjoyable unlike the others.
     I am the eldest granddaughter to my maternal grandparents.
    I chose to do computer Science because I liked studying IT and tutoring the subject at High school. </p>
